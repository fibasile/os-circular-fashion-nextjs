# OSCircularFashion

This is the new front-end based on react and material-ui for the oscircularfashion.com website.

Work in progress as usual

The new front-end also comes with a Rails REST backend [os-circular-fashion-api](http://github.com/fibasile/os-circular-fashion-api).

Migration from the Firebase storage will take place once this is complete.

## TODO 

- Find a way to get data, users and attachment from the firebase store and move it to the rails db.
